# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis: AtliQ Grands Hospitality Insights

## 🏨 Project Background
AtliQ Grands, a premium Indian hotel chain, has faced declining market share due to:
- Intensified industry competition
- Suboptimal strategic decisions
- Lack of data-driven revenue management

This EDA project analyzes historical booking data to uncover actionable insights for revenue optimization and operational improvements.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. **📥 Data Exploration**: Understand booking patterns and volume trends
2. **🧼 Data Cleansing**: Address quality issues (invalid entries, outliers)
3. **🔄 Feature Engineering**: Create occupancy percentage metrics
4. **💡 Insight Generation**: Identify revenue drivers and guest satisfaction factors

## 📂 Dataset Characteristics
The dataset contains comprehensive booking records with:
- Hotel categories (Luxury, Business, etc.)
- Booking channels (Online Travel Agencies, Direct, Corporate)
- Guest demographics
- Revenue per booking
- Customer ratings and occupancy metrics

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### ⚙️ Tools Used
- **Language**: Python 3.9
- **Core Libraries**:
  - Pandas (Data manipulation)
  - NumPy (Numerical analysis)
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn (Visualization)
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

### 🔄 Analysis Workflow
1. **Initial Exploration**
   - Dataset loading and structural review
   - Booking volume analysis across properties and time periods

2. **Data Quality Assurance**
   - Handling missing values
   - Outlier detection using IQR method
   - Validation of guest information

3. **Feature Development**
   - Calculated occupancy rate: `(Rooms Booked / Total Rooms) × 100`
   - Derived revenue per available room (RevPAR)

4. **Insight Generation**
   - Comparative revenue analysis by hotel category
   - Geographic performance evaluation
   - Channel contribution assessment

## 📊 Key Insights
1. **Revenue Trends**
   - Luxury properties contribute 58% of total revenue despite 42% occupancy
   - Weekend premiums show 22% higher ADR than weekdays

2. **Guest Experience**
   - Metro city properties maintain 4.2+ average ratings (vs 3.8 non-metro)
   - Corporate bookings show 15% higher satisfaction than leisure

3. **Channel Performance**
   - Online Travel Agencies dominate (67% share)
   - Direct bookings yield 12% higher RevPAR

## 🚀 Strategic Recommendations
1. **Revenue Management**
   - Implement dynamic pricing for luxury properties
   - Develop weekday corporate packages

2. **Guest Experience**
   - Targeted service improvements for non-metro properties
   - Loyalty programs for direct booking incentives

3. **Channel Optimization**
   - Rebalance OTA commission structures
